# Typing of the Dead text extractor

## What does this do?

This is a small program that decrypts and decodes the text strings from the 2000 PC port of _The Typing of the Dead_.

## How do I use this?

Locate your ToTD installation directory and place `totd_text_extractor.py` in the `word` subfolder thereof.
Run `python totd_text_extractor.py` to extract the data.

## What doesn't this do?

It doesn't extract the text from the Japanese releases. It also doesn't extract any of the dictionary metadata.
It has only been tested with the US release and may fail with the UK release by Xplosiv.
